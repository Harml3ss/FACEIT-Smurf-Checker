# FACEIT-Smurf-Checker
### Google Chrome Extension that evaluates Steam and FACEIT data to generate a smurf* probability and display it on profiles and matchrooms.


This is just a little hobby project for me to learn the basics of chrome extensions. You will most likely find bad code practices and other beginner mistakes.


*smurf: ("definition" from urbandictionary.com)
> In online gaming, a smurf is an experienced player who uses a new account to deceive other players into thinking he's a noob (newbie). The purpose is usually to play against less skilled opponents who will under-estimate the 'smurf'. The expected result is that the smurf will pwn (dominate) his opponents and humiliate them further as they have been now beaten by an apparent noob.
