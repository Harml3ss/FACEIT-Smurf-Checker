This is just a little hobby project for me to learn the basics of chrome extensions. You will most likely find bad code practices and other beginner mistakes. Also, some of the code is directly taken from Pohearts' [FACEIT HELPER](https://github.com/Poheart/FACEIT-HELPER)


*smurf: ("definition" from urbandictionary.com)
> In online gaming, a smurf is an experienced player who uses a new account to deceive other players into thinking he's a noob (newbie). The purpose is usually to play against less skilled opponents who will under-estimate the 'smurf'. The expected result is that the smurf will pwn (dominate) his opponents and humiliate them further as they have been now beaten by an apparent noob.
